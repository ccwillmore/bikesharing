## Analysis of the New York City citibike business  

### Overview of the analysis:  

Data for the month of August 2019 usership of the citibikes in New York City are interpreted as an analog for a proposed citibike program in Des Moines.  The New York CIty dataset contains data for each bike ride including:  
1. Starting and ending time  
2. Starting and ending station location  
3. Trip duration  
4. Type of user- subscriber or one time user  
5. Gender  
6. Birth year  
  
The data show that that the riders are dominantly males 40 years old and younger.  This gives the Des Moines citibike team an idea of the likely target customer base.  It also highlights a challenge and an opportunity- the relative lack of female customers.  
  
### Results:  

![Slide 1](slide_1.png)  
Slide 1 shows the basic demographic breakdown of the New York City citibike riders:  
- 81% of the rides are by subscribers rather than onetime riders.  
- Most riders were born after 1970.  
- 65% of riders were male and 25% were female.  The remainder did not report a gender.  
- There were a total of 2,344,224 rides in August.  There were approximately 0.28 rides per person living in New York City.

Slide 2 focuses on the bike commuters in New York City- the source of the majority of the rides.  The maps show the locations where most of the rides start and stop for the hours from 5 to 9 am.  Commuters travel from stations in the residential centers to the commercial centers.  A map of residential areas and commercial areas of Des Moines will help to plan locations for stations and the number of bikes required

Slide 3 shows the total number of rides per hour in the day.  Rides are colored by user type.  The distribution shows that the best time for bike maintainance is from midnight to 5 am.  Citibike Des Moines will need a team of mechanics that can repair bikes and clean and maintain stations in the early morning hours.  
  
![Slide 4](slide_4.png)  
Slide 4 shows the number of bike rides broken out by hour and day of the week.  In addition to the hours of midnight to 5 am there are low ridership times during the work week that could be used for maintainance.  
The low ridership during the workday presents an opportunity to market the bikes to more than just commuters.  Are there changes to the bikes (adding capacity to carry loads such as bags of groceries) or to pricing that could increase usage in the down times?  
  
![Slide 5](slide_5.png)  
Slide 5 shows the  duration of the bike rides.  Most of the rides are under 1 hour.  The short ride durations suggest that the bikes are used for point-to-point trips rather than round trips.  This is good for business in New York City- short trips insure that the bikes are available for more users.  
  
![Slide 6](slide_6.png) 
Slide 6 is the same data from slide 5 broken out by gender.  There are no significant differences in the duration of rides between men and women.  The difference is mainly the total number of rides for men and women.  

![Slide 7](slide_7.png)  
Slide 7 is a set of heat maps showing the number of rides per hour by day of the week.  The data again highlight the opportunity to increase rides by females.  Hopefully this slide will provike discussion of how to narrow the gender gap.  Here are a couple of ideas:  
1. Make the bikes comfortable for women dressed for work.  
2. Make the stations clean, well lit, and safe.  
  
![Slide 8](slide_8.png)  
Slide 8 again drives home the points that the main customers for citibikes are commuters and that there is an opportunity to expand use among females.  
  
### Summary:  
  
The analysis shows that daily work commuters are the cornerstone of the New York City citibike program.  The stations and bikes are distributed across the city to provide easy access in both residential and commercial areas.  However, the data show that the New York City citibikes program is not appealing to female commuters.  Making citibikes appealing for females will greatly increase the potential profits.  
  
#### Additional analysis:  

A map of starting and ending locations for the rides during the work day (between 10 am and 4 pm) could help to understand how bikes are being used outside of the morning and afternoon commutes.  
  
A demographic breakdown by age and gender of the rides between the morning and afternoon commutes could help to understand how to market the bikes to increase non-commuting rides.
